        <h2>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h2>
        <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, Leonhard Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics, Johann Bernoulli, and at the age of twenty was awarded a Master of Philosophy degree. After moving to St. Petersburg to work at the Academy of Sciences, Euler published over 80 volumes of research in nearly all areas of pure and applied mathematics.</p>
        <p>Euler's contributions to mathematics include concepts that are now standard topics in textbooks, such as the Euler formula in complex analysis, the Euler line in geometry, and the Euler-Maclaurin formula in numerical analysis. Euler was a pioneer in graph theory and introduced much of the modern notation used in mathematics, including the concept of a function and the notation e for the base of the natural logarithm.</p>
        <p>One of Euler's most famous results is his formula for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the positive integers, which led to the discovery of the zeta function and the distribution of prime numbers.</p>
        <blockquote>e<sup>iπ</sup> + 1 = 0</blockquote>
        <p>Euler's work connects the seemingly disparate fields of algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation e<sup>iθ</sup> = cos(θ) + i sin(θ) which relates the fundamental constants e, i, 0, 1, π, and θ in a single beautiful and elegant statement.</p>
        <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>
